				<p> Hi, my name is Daniela Dantas and I am from Brazil. To be more specific, I am from a city called Salvador from the North-Est of the country. Salvador is a beautiful city with a coastline that runs the whole city, giving us a great view and amazing beaches. The picture <a href="images/header_pic.jpg">(up here)</a> is from one of our greatest views of the bay.
My main interests are photography, reading, yoga, video editing and watching films and TV series. My newest challenge is to learn web development and design.
</p>
